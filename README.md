Abstract
Today, there is great interest in diets proposing new combinations of macronutrient compositions and fasting schedules to ultimately achieve metabolic health, weight changes and fat loss. Of these proposed diets, a carbohydrate restrictive diet called ketogenic diet is promising several health benefits compared to traditional non-macronutrient restrictive diets. Unfortunately, there is little consensus regarding the effect that ketogenic diet has on our metabolism. In pursuit of a consensus, several clinical studies have been conducted. However, since these available studies measure different sets of variables in different populations, and in different settings they only provide partial and non-connected insights of the metabolic changes induced by ketogenic diet. We collectively lack an approach for integrating all such partial insights into a useful and interconnected big picture. Herein, I suggest such an approach - a physiologically based mathematical model, called a Digital twin, with capabilities far more extensive than previous published diet response models. In order to develop such a model new data was collected over a time period of 16 weeks with fully declared meals, physical energy expenditure, and time continues data on total body weight, body composition, plasma glucose and plasma ketones. The model development is data driven, partly dependent on the new data and partly dependent by pre-existing clinical data. Partial insights from the different studies are integrated using the model and used to simulate studies not used in parameter estimation. Finally, the model is used to provide clarity to the impact of ketogenic diet to our metabolic health and dieting long-term impact on basic metabolic rate.

Instructions
All scripts, functions, models, and data used are attached in this folder. Please run scripts initially through the script called "main" to ensure that all data and variables are loaded properly. To be able to create a mex file you need a comparable complier (for example MinGW64 Compiler) and IQM toolbox installed. The script "LoadEverything.m" will help you install IQMtools if you unzip folder and place the single "IQMtools" folder, that contains all IQM files, in your directory. Otherwise, please see attached map "IQMtools" and read the instructions listed to manually install.

If needed, please contact Oscar.Arrestam@liu.se for any questions.
